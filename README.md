# Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model

## Overview of the Project

- I used Amazon SageMaker on AWS to train and deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model for this project. 
- This model will be trained to analyse movie reviews for sentiment (positive or negative reviews). 
- I generated the model, deployed it, and set up a portal for accessing it from a website.
